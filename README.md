# RBAD - A Dataset and Benchmark for Retinal Vessels Branching Angle Detection

We offer an open-source annotation tool and a benchmark dataset comprising 40 images annotated with retinal branching angles. Additionally, this project presents a novel method for detecting retinal branching angles using a self-configured image processing technique. Our methodology for retinal branching angle detection and calculation is detailed, followed by a benchmark analysis comparing our method with previous approaches.
